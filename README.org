* UIUC PCB Ruler
[[./uiuc_pcb_ruler.jpg]]
This is a multi-function ruler that has tools for wire gauge
measurement and component footprint estimation, trace width
estimation, a protractor, tables for resistance values, preferred
numbers, and conversions, various formulae/constants/circuit diagrams
on the silkscreen, and of course gold-finger millimeter/centimeter,
inch, and metric inch rulers. It's built using a PCB manufactured
with a black solder mask and white silkscreen. The contacts are gold,
manufactured using an ENIG (electroless nickel immersion gold)
process.
